The lab 7 code will almost plug and play into the project.  The reading part of the
program already exists in project 4, and the rest can be put into a new method called
UCompare or something, and can take the UserDB as a parameter to compare to whatever 
user you call it on.  It will find the most similar user, and find a movie in their list
to recommend, probably the one with the highest rating that is not on the other users's 
seenMovies list.  However, it may be possible to still find a user who has not seen any 
movies that the user being compared has not seen.  I will have to think about that problem.
