This program welcomes the user to USFlix and then asks the user for a keyword.  Then it opens the file named movies and
reads it line by line using a for loop and storing storing each line as an object of a list array named titles. Then, it 
takes the titles list and, using a for loop, compares each object in the list against the keyword inputed by the user. 
The ones that contain or match the keyword are then added to the string results, and once the for loop has iterated fully,
the results string is printed.
