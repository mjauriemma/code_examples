This program makes a database of users and a database of movies, then asks
the user to log in either with a stored username or to create an account. 
It checks the password and the uniqueness of the username, then will prompt
you to login.  Once in you can search for movies and choose to 'watch' them
and rate them.  The ratings are stored and you can check previous ratings 
of the movies as well.
