My program first tests the args[0] entry (which should be the filename)
and attempts to run with it.  If that does not work, then it prompts the 
user for a file name.  It will test the user input, and, if the file is not
found, the program will ask the user for another filename, until one is found.

The program will then read the doubles out of the file and classify each into
one of the rating areas, keeping track of the number of entries it reads.  When 
all the doubles have been read, for loops will create strings of asterisks to print 
out with the ratings, and a long print statement prints the text block giving the user
the number of reviews and where each one falls on the rating scale.
