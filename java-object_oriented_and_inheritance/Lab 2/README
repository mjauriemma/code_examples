This program takes in user input for both a user name and a password. The program takes the stored user name and looks for a file with that name.  If found it reads the first line which is the password for that username.  Then the program asks for the password from the user.  It compares the password to the user input and either acccepts or rejects it based on whether or not they match.  If it does not match, the program prints out Invalid password and asks again, up to three times.  After the third invalid password, the program terminates.
