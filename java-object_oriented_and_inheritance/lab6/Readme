I believe that the iteration is the better design.  Not only does it have
less of an impact on your stack, it is just simpler.  The recursive loop is
harder to code, and required another method to make it run correctly. Not to
mention, the recursive code is an almost exact copy of the iterative code. Only
instead of a for, it has a base case and a recursive call.  I don't believe that
recursion was necessary in this case, nor is it practical as an iterative loop is
far simpler, and easier to explain/code and does the exact same job.
