The lab 7 code is split into 2 functions, one in User Database which creates a new 
Array out of the user database and passes it into the user class with user being compared.
The function in User takes the seen movies of the user and uses the ratings to and 
compares those ratings to the other seen movies of all the other users, and makes a Array
of the common values (Difference of the ratings/number of common movies).  It takes the
seen movies list of the most common user, copies it, and removes the movies seen by the 
user passed in, and returns that list into driver, which passes it into a modified list menu
function and prints out.  
If the user changes ratings or 'watches' a new movie, when he asks for recommendations, it 
recalculates the common values, and will potentially get a new user with more in common than
the previous one.
