This program creates objects by passing information from Driver into the various constructors of the different
subclasses of specific animals.  Getters and Setters in each subclass allow one to modify height and weight for
each object of that subclass.  The objects of the subclasses are stored on ArrayLists with the type of the super 
class of the subclasses.  Each time an object in created in the constructor, the counter for the super class and
the zoo class both increase the count of superclass and total animals.  Using a for loop, the objects are printed
off the array lists in the toString method of each subclass.  The counts are also printed to give the number of 
animals, mammals, and reptiles. 

Inheritance is helpful in this for some things not everyone should be able to change or see, while others should
be visible to all.  For example, the nickName of each animal is visible to everyone, but in order to make it 
unchangeable, the final modifier is added to it. This way the nickName of the animal cannot be changed.  The 
animal counters cannot be changed by an outside package, or seen by an outside package.  Also since they are static
they will not change for different objects or subclasses, they will be the same in each class. And, since they
are protected, the constructors in each class can add to them.  The ArrayLists I made private so Driver can use them,
but no other class can. That way only Driver can modify and read them, and print them using the toString methods. 
The getters and setters are public for the weight and height, because an animal can be constantly growing, or gaining
or losing weight.
